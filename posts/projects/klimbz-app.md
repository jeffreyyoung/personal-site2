Every few weeks I participate in a climbing league where we are required to record climbs with a clunky not so mobile friendly web page.  As a little side project I wanted to write an App that would make the process of recording climbs easier.

I thought it would be cool to have an app where you could authenticate with Facebook, and then view all your own climbs and the climbs of your friends in a social media sort of way.

To make recording climbs easier I thought it would be more user friendly if users could simply record climbs by scanning a QR code next to the route which they had just completed.

After scanning a QR code the route info would be auto entered.
