Wanting to get into freelance web development, I built the website you are looking at!

### Technology Used

I built this website over one weekend using React.js, Next.js, and Semantic UI.  I write categorized posts (like the project post you are reading) in mark down, and then use a generator to generate static html from all the markdown files.  By doing that, I can host a simple static website for free on github pages without having to pay for servers.
