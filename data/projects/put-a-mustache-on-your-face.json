{"project":{"html":"<p>After starting and not finishing too many overly ambitious projects.  I decided to build a simple web app where a user could login with facebook, select a photo, and then view that photo with a mustache on it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/mustache-demo.gif\" alt=\"Demo of Put A Mustache On Your Face .com\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"technology-used\">Technology Used</h3>\n<p>To build this app I created a front end server to host the user interface, and a backend API server to supply the user interface with data.</p>\n<p>I built the front end server with node.js, React JS, Next.js, and Semantic UI.  By using Next.js I was able to get up and running with a server side rendered app quickly.</p>\n<p>I wrote the backend API in Python.  I used flask and graphene to create a graphql server, and I used <a href=\"https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition\">https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition</a> for the face recognition.  I used Dynamodb to store user data, and Amazon s3 to store images.</p>\n<p>To make deployments simple, I wrapped both of the servers in docker containers and deployed those containers to Elastic Beanstalk on AWS.</p>","meta":{"title":"Put A Mustache On Your Face .com","image":"/images/mustache.png","imageDescription":"Image of A Person With A mustache On Their Face","category":"projects","order":4,"description":"A website that you can use to put a mustache on your face."}},"nextProject":{"title":"Put A Mustache On Your Face .com","image":"/images/mustache.png","imageDescription":"Image of A Person With A mustache On Their Face","description":"A website that you can use to put a mustache on your face.","url":"/projects/put-a-mustache-on-your-face"}}
